## Introduction

The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) worldwide has driven the need for an extensive and well-placed charging infrastructure. In Ho Chi Minh City, where urbanization and traffic congestion continue to rise, optimizing the placement of EV charging stations is not only essential for supporting electric mobility but also for improving the city’s sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. However, the effective placement of these charging stations presents a complex challenge, involving numerous factors such as population density, vehicle distribution, energy demand, and land costs.

This thesis, titled **“Research on placement optimization of electric vehicles charging stations at Ho Chi Minh City using a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming model,”** aims to address this challenge by developing a mathematical model to optimize the location of charging stations. The model employs Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), which integrates both integer and continuous variables, to capture the complex relationships between the placement of charging stations and the city's unique geographical and socio-economic conditions. By leveraging this approach, the study seeks to provide practical solutions that not only minimize the overall costs but also ensure accessibility and efficiency for EV users.

The research, conducted by **Vu Truc Quynh (2114113133)** from **class K60F, FTU2**, focuses on the strategic deployment of EV charging stations in key areas across the city, taking into account constraints such as budget limitations, land availability, and energy consumption. The results of this study will contribute to the development of a more sustainable urban transport system in Ho Chi Minh City, enhancing the city's ability to support the growing adoption of electric vehicles.
